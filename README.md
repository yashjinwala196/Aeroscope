# Aeroscope
AeroScope was born out of a passion for Formula 1 engineering and curiosity about how teams design their cars differently to chase every millisecond of performance.Watching F1 races, we noticed how even small aerodynamic updates could completely change a carâ€™s speed &amp; that inspired us to build a tool that could see those differences scientifically.
